tmsd (termux-mate-settings-daemon) It is a configuration daemon (unofficial) for the Mate desktop environment in termux

![preview](./preview/showcase.png)

## Features

- Change themes, cursors, icons and fonts. 
- Change WM theme
- Edit autostart apps 
- Edit tweaks settings (compositor) 
- Edit workspace settings 
- Edit default applications

## Components used

- Notification daemon: lxqt-notificationd
- Settings daemon: tmsd (using other apps to work)
- Desktop service: xfdesktop
- Window manager: xfwm4

## GUI settings App 

- Using python and tkinter backend

# Notes 
 
Even though xfwm4 is used, for some reason the optimization is still hight, has a very good performance.

When changing a gtk or font theme, you must restart the vnc section or server (close and reopen it) for your changes to be successfully uploaded.

> Remember that this is only a temporary solution while termux manages to compile all the matte components, which may take a long time. 

# Installation

**Install dependencies :**

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install lxappearance libxtst clang make python-tkinter qt5ct xfdesktop xfce4-settings xfwm4 mate-*

Check the "Show hidden" option and disable mate-settings-daemon, 
Then activate the tmsd option (termux-mate-settings-daemon)
